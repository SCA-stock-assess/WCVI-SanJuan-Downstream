# WCVI San Juan River Downstream Project


This repository is for data and analyses within the San Juan downstream (RST) report published 2026 (link when available). 


This work is one component of a larger project funded under Pacific Salmon Strategy Initiative (PSSI) Pillar 1.1, the San Juan Juvenile and Adult Assesment Program. The project is linked to and includes results from the Follow the Fish Program.

The work and reporting here contains everything related to the downstream (freshwater) movement of juvenile Chinook and other salmonids on the San Juan River. Results from nearshore marine and estuary work will be provided in a subsequent report.
